I am a software developer and have worked on a varied number of projects.
I have also participated and won a few projects in ETHGlobal and ETHIndia hackathon tracks.
For past couple years I have been interested in ethereum and blockchain projects
and very much believe in the ethos and need of a decentralized neutral
global computer and smart contracts for things that matter.

I have contributed a bit to the following projects:

1. [`ethers-rs`](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs) - it is a rust library for interacting with ethereum and evm compatible blockchains.
2. [`foundry`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) - foundry is the successor and rust rewrite of the [`dapptools`](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools) project.

Currently, I am working on the following:

1. [`solidity-analyzer`](https://github.com/parmanuxyz/solidity-analyzer) - A solidity LSP that integrates and provides better devex to foundry/dapptools projects written in rust.
